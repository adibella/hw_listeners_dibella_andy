##Resources Used
* [HTML DOM addEventListener() Method](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_addeventlistener.asp) This gave me some insight into the use of addEventListener().
* [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) I used this to gain some further understanding of commands and the DOM.
* Everything else I was able to piece together thorugh notes, lectures, and the links above.

##Comments

This was a pretty big struggle for me. Toward the end I felt like I was really getting a handle on things and was able to adequately figure out the first two sections.

The largest struggle I had was with the custom portion. I think I was able to get the javascript right, but for some reason in the console on Chrome I always encountered an error stating 

**"main.js:5 Uncaught TypeError:header.addEventListener is not a function**

I'm not sure why this is happening, since I used the exact same code in the other sections and it worked. I'm totally cool with losing points since as far as I can tell I can't test my listeners. Please tell me what I'm doing wrong!
